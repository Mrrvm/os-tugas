# How can experimental writing can deconstruct the celebrated narratives of colonialism that define Portuguese national identity?
## Introduction

In Portugal, the violence of colonisation is not fully acknowledged but is instead highly glorified. Every child undergoes a socialisation process that fosters a strong national identity aligned with the colonial period, called *"Descobrimentos"* (meaning "Discoveries"). This is executed through a selective apparatus for the production and distribution of knowledge in schools, monuments, public spaces, language, and other tools, as well as at home. The consequences of the associated violence are always omitted, minimised, or relativised, shapeshifting into to the spread of christian faith, comercial trade towards globalisation, a glorification of "heroic" navigation deeds, or the “enrichment/civilisation” of other cultures. 

One of the mechanisms is the mandatory school reading and interpretation of *Os Lusíadas*. This very famous book is an epic poem written by Luis de Camões in the 16th century, that recounts the first journey to India by sea. The book is very strict - it contains 10 chapters, consisting of 8816 ten-syllable verses (mostly heroic deca-syllables: stressed on the 6th and 10th syllables) and 1102 eight-line stanzas (octaves). The rhymes used are alternating and paired. 

I intend to investigate how I can rewrite *Os Lusíadas*, using experimental writing techniques together with texts, books, media, scripts, and other artefacts within lusophony. I envision this project as long-term and I am using my graduation period at Willem de Kooning Academie to investigate and produce prototypes of what it can be while creating a solid understanding of why I am doing this, its context, meaning, relevance to this day, materiality, resources and methodologies of work. Later on, I would like to request funding and carry on with the work through continuous collaboration with others, as I look for an understanding on how to work rhizomatically.

## How are narratives of colonialism celebrated within Portuguese culture?

### The role of Portugal in colonialism

### Dictatorship, government and lusotropicalism
references: [[As marcas do luso-tropicalismo nas intervenções do Presidente da República português]]

### Celebrations and the lack of memory

#### Monuments, streets and festivals

#### Music, language and food

#### **[[Os Lusíadas]]** and education
- Content about Camões' epic poem..., 
- Canto I - Israel/Palestine
#### Personal experiences


## What is national identity (a nation) and how does it relate to these narratives?

### Nation as defined per myth
references: [[Narration and Nation - Homi K. Bhabha]]

### How do epic poems solidify the myth?
references: [[Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics]]

### Saudade está a morrer de fome
 (The Power and Limits of Cultural Myths in Portugal’s Search for a Post-Imperial Role, Bruno C. Reis and Pedro A. Oliveira; # “Portugality”: a nothingness that is nothing, E. Lourenço; Eduardo Lourenço – an analysis of the Portuguese destiny, E. Lourenço, and such...)
 
## Rhizomatic methodologies for rewriting

### What is experimental writing and how can it be applied as tool in this context?

#### Can experimental writing be rhizomatic?
_Un coup de dés jamais n’abolira le hasard_ and Livre Total

#### Rewriting [[Os Lusíadas]] with with ex-colonial and diasporic media

##### Maintaining its structure or not
##### Balancing between appropriation and appreciation
