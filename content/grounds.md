# How can experimental writing can deconstruct the celebrated narratives of colonialism that define Portuguese national identity?

## Introduction

In Portugal, the violence of colonisation is not fully acknowledged but is instead highly glorified. Every child undergoes a socialisation process that fosters a strong national identity aligned with the colonial period, called *"Descobrimentos"* (meaning "Discoveries"). This is executed through a selective apparatus for the production and distribution of knowledge in schools, monuments, public spaces, language, and other tools, as well as at home. The consequences of the associated violence are always omitted, minimised, or relativised, shapeshifting into to the spread of christian faith, comercial trade towards globalisation, a glorification of "heroic" navigation deeds, or the “enrichment/civilisation” of other cultures. 

One of the mechanisms is the mandatory school reading and interpretation of [[Os Lusíadas]]. This very famous book is an epic poem written by [[Luís de Camões]] in the 16th century, that recounts the first journey to India by sea. The book is very strict - it contains 10 chapters, consisting of 8816 ten-syllable verses (mostly heroic deca-syllables: stressed on the 6th and 10th syllables) and 1102 eight-line stanzas (octaves). The rhymes used are alternating and paired. 

I intend to investigate how I can rewrite [[Os Lusíadas]], using experimental writing techniques together with texts, books, media, scripts, and other artefacts within lusophony. I envision this project as long-term and I am using my graduation period at Willem de Kooning Academie to investigate and produce prototypes of what it can be while creating a solid understanding of why I am doing this, its context, meaning, relevance to this day, materiality, resources and methodologies of work. Later on, I would like to request funding and carry on with the work through continuous collaboration with others, as I look for an understanding on how to work rhizomatically.

## How are narratives of colonialism celebrated within Portuguese culture?

### The celebrated lack of memory
Throughout the whole country and culture you can find traces of celebration of the colonial period, without looking very far. These goes from monuments, statues, museums street names and festivals, to its presence in music, what is or is not considered language, in education, or even simple interactions with others.
#### Monuments, streets and festivals
Having lived in the south of Portugal, Algarve, up until I was 17 (in 2014), I was always confronted with the economic discrepancies between retired northern europeans and the locals. Whole cities and regions, such as Vilamoura, Vale de Lobo, Quinta to Lago, were and are completely catered to this social class of immigrants, with lavish golf resorts, beach hotels, empty holiday mansions, and whatnot, while, the basic needs of the local population remain chronically under-resourced — water, public transport, healthcare, education, ... Beaches, dunes and their biodiversity have also been destroyed for the sake of touristic profit (e.g. Quarteira). Algarve is also the home of the city of  [[Lagos]] - the birth place of the Portuguese colonial period. Yet I have never in those 17 years seen or heard anything regarding this. Clearly there was an intentional effort and money put into making higher social classes in the region more comfortable in recent years, yet none into accommodating a much older social class of immigration driven from the Portuguese ex-colonies. In fact, the opposite has been done.

In 2016, the city opened the [[Núcleo Museológico Rota da Escravatura]], a museum which they call "Slave" market. This is the first and only museum about slavery in the whole country. While visiting, you discover that during excavations in 2009 for a parking lot, they found around 155 enslaved bodies that had been dropped in a rubbish dump (see [[Núcleo Museológico Rota da Escravatura#^found-enslaved-bodies]]). To enter the museum, you must pass by a plaza named Infante Dom Henrique (the perpetuator of the first navigations) with his statue in the middle, and if you walk a few meters further down, you find some more symbols, such as Vasco da Gama and [[Luís de Camões]] (the writer of [[Os Lusíadas]]). If you continue towards the south after visiting the museum, you find a statue of Gil Eanes, the navigator who passed through Western Sahara, where the first Africans were kidnapped and subsequently shipped to Portugal (see [[Portuguese Slave Trade]]). The main street of the city is called *Avenida dos "Descobrimentos"*. Every 2 years the city holds a festival (see [[Lagos#^festival-colonial]]) cosplaying the colonial epoch, congratulating the navigators who were born in the city, for their "great adventure", "challenging" the unknown and "transforming" the ocean in a "bridge" between two continents. The whole use of language coming from the city's council (see [[Memórias da plantação#^palavra-descobrimentos]] both regarding the word *"Descobrimentos"* - "Discoveries" and *"escrava/o"* - "slave", and the assertion of pride in the city, such as *"(...) desvendaram os primeiros segredos dos oceanos (...)"* - uncovered the first secrets of the ocean), localisation and connection between monuments, obsession with glorifying and even cos-playing this period, digging bodies of enslaved people, showcasing them in the museum ( [[Slave Market Museum - Contested Stories#^displayed-body]]) and building a mini-golf court on the burial site (see [[Found bodies#^burial-site]]), while intentionally omitting any references to kidnapping, enslavement, and murder of displaced peoples as well as violence perpetuated in the ex-colonies (see [[Atlantica - contemporary art from Cabo Verde, Guinea Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe and their Diásporas#^return-colonial-pain-to-its-thinkers]]) leaves the slavery museum looking like a very clear performance of a fake reconciliation with the past. Moreover, when referring to the museum, the president of the municipality at the time refers to it as a driver for tourism (see [[Núcleo Museológico Rota da Escravatura#^colonial-period-as-tourism]] and [[Slave Market Museum - Contested Stories#^museum-erasure]]).
