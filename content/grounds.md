# How can experimental writing help deconstruct the celebrated narratives of colonialism that define Portuguese national identity?

## Introduction

In Portugal, the violence of colonisation is not fully acknowledged but is instead highly glorified. Every child undergoes a socialisation process that fosters a strong national identity aligned with the colonial period, called *"Descobrimentos"* (meaning "Discoveries"). This is executed through a selective apparatus for the production and distribution of knowledge in schools, monuments, public spaces, language, and other tools, as well as at home. The consequences of the associated violence are always omitted, minimised, or relativised, shapeshifting into to the spread of christian faith, comercial trade towards globalisation, a glorification of "heroic" navigation deeds, or the “enrichment/civilisation” of other cultures. 

One of the mechanisms is the mandatory school reading and interpretation of [[Os Lusíadas]]. This very famous book is an epic poem written by [[Luís de Camões]] in the 16th century, that recounts an imagined version of the first journey to India by sea. The book is very strict - it contains 10 chapters, consisting of 8816 ten-syllable verses (mostly heroic deca-syllables: stressed on the 6th and 10th syllables) and 1102 eight-line stanzas (octaves). The rhymes used are alternating and paired. 

I intend to investigate how I can rewrite [[Os Lusíadas]], using experimental writing techniques together with texts, books, media, scripts, and other artifacts within Lusophony. In this text, I create a solid understanding of why I am doing this, its context, meaning, relevance to this day, materiality, resources and methodologies of work. This is a dynamic research that constantly changes and will be carried on through continuous collaboration with others, as I look for an understanding on how to work rhizomatically.

I will begin by explaining how Portugal played a massive role in the transatlantic enslaved trade until the last century, how colonial violence has been omitted in the last decades and in which ways colonialism is still celebrated in Portuguese society, including the mandatory reading of  [[Os Lusíadas]] working as a beacon for national identity. Further on I will shortly dive in the concept of national identity and nation, in order to understand its relation to epic poems and its tumultuous case within Portugal. Lastly, I analyse experimental writing in this context, presenting the methodologies I am using for the re-writing of the original book and their potential to be rhizomatic, and explain how I intend to carry both transparency and opacity along the project.

## How are narratives of colonialism celebrated within Portuguese culture?

### The role of Portugal in colonialism

Not considering the current neocolonialist empires, Portugal was both the first and last European empire.

(add timeline of events)

Throughout the whole country and culture you can find traces of celebration of the colonial period, without looking very far. This goes from monuments, statues, museums street names and festivals, to its presence in music, what is or is not considered language, in education, or even simple interactions with others.

### Monuments, streets and festivals

Having lived in the south of Portugal, Algarve, up until I was 17 (in 2014), I was always confronted with the economic discrepancies between retired northern europeans and the locals. Whole cities and regions, such as Vilamoura, Vale de Lobo, Quinta do Lago, were and are completely catered to this social class of immigrants (which we call *estrangeiros* - foreigners, rather than immigrants), with lavish golf resorts, beach hotels, empty holiday mansions, and whatnot, while, the basic needs of the local population remain chronically under-resourced — water, public transport, healthcare, education, ... Beaches, dunes and their biodiversity have also been destroyed for the sake of touristic profit (e.g. the beaches and dunes of Quarteira). 

Algarve is the home for the city of [[Lagos]] - the birth place of the Portuguese colonial period. Yet I have never in those 17 years seen or heard anything regarding this. Clearly there was an intentional effort and money put into making higher social classes in the region more comfortable in recent years, yet none into accommodating a much older social class of immigration driven from the Portuguese former colonies. In fact, the opposite has been done.

In 2016, the city opened the [[Núcleo Museológico Rota da Escravatura]], a museum which they call "Slave" market. This is the first and only museum about slavery in the whole country. While visiting, you discover that during excavations in 2009 for a parking lot, they found around 155  bodies from enslaved people that had been dropped in a rubbish dump[^found-bodies]. To enter the museum, you must first pass by a plaza named Infante Dom Henrique (the perpetuator of the first navigations) with his statue in the middle, and if you walk a few meters further down, you find some more symbols, such as Vasco da Gama and [[Luís de Camões]]. If you continue towards the south after visiting the museum, you find a statue of Gil Eanes, who "first" passed through Western Sahara, where the first Africans were kidnapped and subsequently shipped to Portugal[^portuguese-slave-trade-page]. The main street of the city is called *Avenida dos "Descobrimentos"*. Every 2 years the city holds a festival[^lagos-festival] cosplaying the colonial epoch and congratulating the perpetuators of the colonial period who were born in the city, for their "great adventure", "challenging" the unknown and "transforming" the ocean in a "bridge" between two continents. The whole use of language coming from the city's council[^escravizados-palavra], the assertion of pride in the city, such as claiming *"(...) desvendaram os primeiros segredos dos oceanos (...)"* [^lagos-brochura]- uncovered the first secrets of the ocean -, the localisation and connection between monuments, obsession with glorifying and even cos-playing this period, digging bodies of enslaved people, showcasing them in the museum[^slave-market-essay] and building a mini-golf court on the burial site[^lagos-minigolf], while at the same time intentionally omitting any references to the kidnapping, enslavement, and murder of displaced peoples as well as violence perpetuated in the former colonies[^atlantica-colonial-pain] leaves the slavery museum looking like a very clear performance of a fake reconciliation with the past. Moreover, when referring to the museum, the president of the municipality at the time referred to it as a driver for tourism[^lagos-museum-tourism-erasure]. 

In respect to memorial sites, Lisbon does not fall much further. In 2017, the association DJES (Association of Afrodescendents) proposed the city's council, as part of the participatory budget contest, to build a memorial site paying homage to the victims of the Atlantic enslaved trade. The municipality agreed to the project, and DJES made an open-call for 5 invited artists to foresee this project. The idea of Kiluanji Kia Henda - a plantation of sugar cane - was chosen to be implemented, but after 8 years is yet to become a reality, as the city's council keeps creating various obstacles towards execution, including inexplicable times between replies, changing previously set locations, producing fake images in relation to the artist's original idea, etc. A similar case, happened with Batoto Yetu Portugal, who tried to create 20 signs and a bust honouring African presence in Lisbon. The artworks were fully completed in 2020, there is a budget for setting them up in the city funded by the association itself, yet the process remains stale[^10]. One could argue in defense for the economic condition of the country (and consequential waiting times), however, in 2023, the government, the city of Loures and Lisbon, spent together 75 million euros[^papa] to receive the pope, which then is already deemed acceptable due to the returns on tourism.

Throughout the city you can find numerous instruments glorifying the colonial period, such as *Padrão dos "Descobrimentos"* [^padrao-descobrimentos](that includes a statue of [[Luís de Camões]] writing [[Os Lusíadas]], see [[grounds#^fig-padrao]]), countless caravels and compasses drawn in the sidewalks (see [[grounds#^fig-rosa-dos-ventos]], [[grounds#^fig-rosa-dos-ventos-lagos]]), statues of colonial participants, such as Pedro Alvares Cabral and [[Luís de Camões]], shopping malls designed as caravels or allusive to the colonial period (e.g. Vasco da Gama, Colombo), Villa of the Count of Monte Cristo in Sintra[^sintra-casa], as well as other infrastructure directly connected to the colonial period, like *Rua do Poço dos Negros*, that appears to be one more pit for the dead bodies of the enslaved[^contested-legacies].

The same goes for Porto, where you can find active (re)erected ruins of the colonial period [^noticia-publico] along without any affirmations surrounding its inherent violence. In 1934, the dictatorial government held the "Portuguese Colonial Exhibition", and the "Portuguese World Exhibition" in 1940, similarly to other European countries.

"The most widely accepted interpretation of the street name _Rua do Poço dos Negros_ suggests it being because it was the site of a pit holding the bodies of enslaved people of African origin. The little that we do know with certainty is that King Manuel I issued a royal law in 1515 complaining about dead bodies of enslaved people being abandoned in a dump in this area of the city. In that law he also ordered the City Council to build a pit in which these bodies should be thrown."
