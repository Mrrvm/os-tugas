# How can experimental writing help deconstruct the celebrated narratives of colonialism that define Portuguese national identity?

## Introduction

In Portugal, the violence of colonisation is not fully acknowledged but is instead highly glorified. Every child undergoes a socialisation process that fosters a strong national identity aligned with the colonial period, called *"Descobrimentos"* (meaning "Discoveries"). This is executed through a selective apparatus for the production and distribution of knowledge in schools, monuments, public spaces, language, and other tools, as well as at home. The consequences of the associated violence are always omitted, minimised, or relativised, shapeshifting into to the spread of christian faith, comercial trade towards globalisation, a glorification of "heroic" navigation deeds, or the “enrichment/civilisation” of other cultures. 

One of the mechanisms is the mandatory school reading and interpretation of [[Os Lusíadas]]. This very famous book is an epic poem written by [[Luís de Camões]] in the 16th century, that recounts an imagined version of the first journey to India by sea. The book is very strict - it contains 10 chapters, consisting of 8816 ten-syllable verses (mostly heroic deca-syllables: stressed on the 6th and 10th syllables) and 1102 eight-line stanzas (octaves). The rhymes used are alternating and paired. 

I intend to investigate how I can rewrite [[Os Lusíadas]], using experimental writing techniques together with texts, books, media, scripts, and other artifacts within Lusophony. In this text, I create a solid understanding of why I am doing this, its context, meaning, relevance to this day, materiality, resources and methodologies of work. This is a dynamic research that constantly changes and will be carried on through continuous collaboration with others, as I look for an understanding on how to work rhizomatically.

I will begin by explaining how Portugal played a massive role in the transatlantic enslaved trade until the last century, how colonial violence has been omitted in the last decades and in which ways colonialism is still celebrated in Portuguese society, including the mandatory reading of  [[Os Lusíadas]] working as a beacon for national identity. Further on I will shortly dive in the concept of national identity and nation, in order to understand its relation to epic poems and its tumultuous case within Portugal. Lastly, I analyse experimental writing in this context, presenting the methodologies I am using for the re-writing of the original book and their potential to be rhizomatic, and explain how I intend to carry both transparency and opacity along the project.

## What are the narratives of colonialism celebrated within Portuguese culture?
### The role of Portugal in colonialism

Not considering the current neocolonialist empires, Portugal was both the first and last European empire.

(add timeline of events - [[Portugal and the invention of the atlantic trade of enslaved people, 15–16th centuries - Aurora Almada e Santos]])

Throughout the whole country and culture you can find traces of celebration of the colonial period, without looking very far. This goes from monuments, statues, objects, museums street names and festivals, to its presence in music, what is or is not considered language, in education, or even simple interactions with others.
### Monuments, streets and festivals

Having lived in the south of Portugal, Algarve, up until I was 17 (in 2014), I was always confronted with the economic discrepancies between retired northern europeans and the locals. Whole cities and regions, such as Vilamoura, Vale de Lobo, Quinta do Lago, were and are completely catered to this social class of immigrants (which we call *estrangeiros* - foreigners, rather than immigrants), with lavish golf resorts, beach hotels, empty holiday mansions and whatnot, while, the basic needs of the local population remain chronically under-resourced — water, public transport, healthcare, education, ... Beaches, dunes and their biodiversity have also been destroyed for the sake of touristic profit (e.g. the beaches and dunes of Quarteira). 

Algarve is the home for the city of [[Lagos]] - the birth place of the Portuguese colonial period. Yet I have never in those 17 years seen or heard anything regarding this. Clearly there was an intentional effort and money put into making higher social classes in the region more comfortable in recent years, yet none into accommodating a much older social class of immigration driven from the Portuguese former colonies. In fact, the opposite has been done.

In 2016, the city opened the [[Núcleo Museológico Rota da Escravatura]], a museum which they call "Slave" market. This is the first and only museum about slavery in the whole country. While visiting, you discover that during excavations in 2009 for a parking lot, they found around 155  bodies from enslaved people that had been dropped in a rubbish dump[^found-bodies]. To enter the museum, you must first pass by a plaza named Infante Dom Henrique (the perpetuator of the first navigations) with his statue in the middle, and if you walk a few meters further down, you find some more symbols, such as Vasco da Gama and [[Luís de Camões]]. If you continue towards the south after visiting the museum, you find a statue of Gil Eanes, who "first" passed through Western Sahara, where the first Africans were kidnapped and subsequently shipped to Portugal[^portuguese-slave-trade-page]. The main street of the city is called *Avenida dos "Descobrimentos"*. Every 2 years the city holds a festival[^lagos-festival] cosplaying the colonial epoch and congratulating the perpetuators of the colonial period who were born in the city, for their "great adventure", "challenging" the unknown and "transforming" the ocean into a "bridge" between two continents. The whole use of language coming from the city's council[^escravizados-palavra], the assertion of pride in the city, such as claiming *"(...) desvendaram os primeiros segredos dos oceanos (...)"* [^lagos-brochura]- uncovered the first secrets of the ocean -, the localisation and connection between monuments, obsession with glorifying and even cosplaying this period, digging bodies of enslaved people, showcasing them in the museum[^slave-market-essay] and building a mini-golf court on the burial site[^lagos-minigolf], while at the same time intentionally omitting any references to the kidnapping, enslavement, and murder of displaced peoples as well as violence perpetuated in the former colonies[^atlantica-colonial-pain] leaves the slavery museum looking like a very clear performance of a fake reconciliation with the past. Moreover, when referring to the museum, the president of the municipality at the time referred to it as a driver for tourism[^lagos-museum-tourism-erasure]. 

In respect to memorial sites, Lisbon does not fall much further. In 2017, the association DJES (Association of Afrodescendents) proposed the city's council, as part of the participatory budget contest, to build a memorial site paying homage to the victims of the Atlantic enslaved trade. The municipality agreed to the project, and DJES made an open-call for 5 invited artists to foresee this project. The idea of Kiluanji Kia Henda - a plantation of sugar cane - was chosen to be implemented, but after 8 years is yet to become a reality, as the city's council keeps creating various obstacles towards execution, including inexplicable waiting times between replies, changing previously set locations, producing fake images in relation to the artist's original idea, etc. A similar case, happened with Batoto Yetu Portugal, who created 20 signs and a bust honouring African presence in Lisbon. The artworks were fully completed in 2020, there was a budget for setting them up in the city funded by the association itself, yet the process remained stale until 2024[^batoto]. One could argue in defense for the economic condition of the country (and consequential waiting times), however, in 2023, the government, the city of Loures and Lisbon, spent together 75 million euros[^papa] to receive the pope, which then is already deemed acceptable due to the returns on tourism.

Throughout the city you can find numerous instruments glorifying the colonial period, such as *Padrão dos "Descobrimentos"* [^padrao-descobrimentos](that includes a statue of [[Luís de Camões]] writing [[Os Lusíadas]], see [[grounds#^fig-padrao]]), countless caravels and compasses drawn in the sidewalks (see [[grounds#^fig-rosa-dos-ventos]], [[grounds#^fig-rosa-dos-ventos-lagos]]), statues of the many colonial participants (such as the statue of Father António Vieira[^vieira] surround by what seems to be indigenous children from the Americas, erected in 2017 - [[grounds#^fig-padre]]), shopping malls designed as caravels or allusive to the colonial period (e.g. Vasco da Gama, Colombo), Villa of the Count of Monte Cristo in Sintra[^sintra-casa], as well as other directly connected infrastructure, like *Rua do Poço dos Negros*, that appears to be one more pit for the dead bodies of the enslaved[^contested-legacies].

The same goes for Porto, where you can find active (re)erected ruins of the colonial period [^noticia-publico] without any affirmations surrounding its inherent violence. The city not only has an interactive museum catered to children - the World of Discoveries[^world-discoveries] -, but also held the "Portuguese Colonial Exhibition" in 1934, similarly to other European countries.

### Exhibitionist governments

The exhibition took place in *Palácio de Cristal*, a garden where 1.3 million visitors could go by foot, train or cable car, visit a theatre, a zoo, a tea house, several monuments, as well as inhabitants from the former colonies living on display for the duration of the event - to simulate their "real" habitat. On the entrance of the exhibition stood a temporary statue - the Portuguese Monument to Colonial Effort -, which was later replicated in stone, dismantled in 1943, and re-erected in 1984 under the city's council orders. The statue has been contested through grafitti and art exhibitions (e.g. [[Unearthing memories]] and [[grounds#^fig-fascists-out]]), while it has also been celebrated by the extreme right-wing party "Ergue-te".[^colonial-exhibitions]

In Lisbon, a similar exhibition was held in 1940 - the Portuguese World Exhibition -, attended by 3 million visitors, that left behind the famous touristic attraction - *Padrão dos "Descobrimentos"* - mentioned earlier. Both exhibitions, as Alves, B. notes (together with Peralta, E. and Vicente, F.), contributed to a stereotyped view of the colonised as those who lack civilisation and order, by presenting them as "primitive" in "their natural habitats". Vicente goes further to say that these spaces served as a means to eroticise the empire, making a parallel between femininity and becoming colonised, in contrast with the imperial European masculinity that would dominate it.[^vicente] 

Another more subtle example, was Expo 98, that commemorated 500 years since Vasco da Gama arrived to India. Dressing the ocean as the main theme - "The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future" - and associating it with greenwashed sustainability and environmental protection, the expo attempted to rearrange Portuguese earlier national identity (centred around imperialism and othering) to meet the symbolic demands of neoliberal agendas defined by the new European democracies. Commodifying its violent past into "an exchange value in the cultural and tourist consumption market", as seen above with the city of Lagos. As well as showcasing an open, expansionist and enterprising attitude to secure foreign investment.[^expo98]

All these exhibitions helped at sanitising colonialism, establishing a mystical national identity originating from "the Portuguese as a marine folk, descendant of the 'heroic discoverers of the world', held by fate to the higher call of helping others 'reach civilisation'", “uninterruptedly transmitting the sacred blood” of their heroes, while perpetuating collective epic narratives. [^elsa-epic] Lusotropicalism, as an ideological tool, further helped at legitimising the myth, stating that Portuguese colonialism was (in comparison to other coloniser nations) softer, peaceful, gentle, hybrid, miscegenated, multicultural, and somehow Creole,[^elsa-creole] completely omitting all the sexual violence. 

Gilberto Freyre, the developer of this theory, was invited by the Portuguese government in the 1950s, to visit and analyse the former colonies. His "independent" views on the benign nature of our colonialism became the official doctrine of the dictatorial regime in the 1960s, in order to appease the criticism from other European nations whose colonial regimes had collapsed. Disseminated through textbooks, media, and official documents, the ideas became ingrained in Portuguese culture[^gilberto] and can still be seen in the words of our current President - Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (whose father, interestingly enough, used to be a Governor-General of Mozambique from 1968 until 1970[^rebelo] ). 
### Language and things

In 2016, in a newspaper, our President claims we, as a nation, have an exceptional ability to learn and include others, creating bridges between cultures, civilisations and continents.
In 2017, in a visit to Senegal, he recognises slavery's injustice and consequentially affirms that our country abolished it in 1761 (a lie pushed as anti-racist discourse in both school and day-to-day conversations). This generated protests that called for the President to apologise for slavery in the name of the country, which he still has not. In 2019, in the Day of Portugal (the day that commemorates the death of [[Luís de Camões]]), Marcelo again insists that we are a nation at ease with its past, actively constructing the present and arming the future, encompassed by many 'Portugals' that extend beyond its geographic boundaries. In 2018, in Boston, he states that the USA is a big country, but that Portugal is even bigger, that in fact we have the biggest country in the world. This rhetoric could be comparable to 1934's propaganda: [[grounds#^figpequeno]].[^marcelo] 

In the same year in the WebSummit, Lisbon's mayor - Fernando Medina - offered an astrolabe to the founder of the conference, pointing out that "Lisbon was the capital of the world five centuries ago, (...) From Lisbon departed a great adventure that connected the human race. . . . Today it is you, the engineers, the entrepreneurs, the creators, the innovators, the start-ups, all the companies".[^websummit] 

The list goes on. Like I had mentioned before, you don't have to look far; even the stamps I got at the post office were illustrated accordingly - [[grounds#^fig-stamps]]. The rhetoric bleeds out in dialogues explicitly or implicitly. Paradoxically, we have included a great amount of words from former colonies' languages in our quotidian. For example, the widely used *bué* and *bazar* (from Kimbundu language *mbuwe* and *kubaza*, respectively). Yet not only are these not considered languages by the Portuguese standard (e.g. Badiu), but when it comes to officially including the terms in formal settings, they become slang. As if the miscegenation between languages is only desirable when the objective is to re-iterate our inclusive nature for means of later commodification.

### **[[Os Lusíadas]]** and education

Which leads me to what I want to re-write - [[Os Lusíadas]]. This is THE book - unmatched, unrivaled, irreplaceable, incomparable, transcendent, the pinnacle of Portuguese poetry, due to its rhymes, extremely strict structure, and embezzlement of the nation. In fact, second to this would only be [[A Mensagem]], an homage whose objective was to awake Portugal's "greatness". Published in 1934, the poet Fernando Pessoa sought to rebuild national identity through myth and memory. He revisits Portugal’s past prophetically, contrasting it with the 20th century's decline. And like [[Luís de Camões]], he glorifies national "heroes", urging for a cultural revival into what was called the "Fifth Empire".[^empire]

In school's Portuguese classes, it's mandatory to "analyse" around 123 out of 1102 stanzas of [[Os Lusíadas]], as well as studying (or rather memorising) the interpretation of [[A Mensagem]]. Yet not once, do we reflect upon the contemporary and huge underlying issue behind these two texts. The manner in which they contribute to the rhetoric delineated above is unfathomable. 

- [[Bárbora e Jau]]

- Example The relation between Canto I - Israel/Palestine - [[Memórias da plantação]]

Therefore, while there is numerous works tackling this very urgent concern, 

- from texts (e.g. by [[Amílcar Cabral]], [[Elsa Peralta]], [[Ana Balona de Oliveira]], [[Aurora Almada e Santos]], [[Joacine Katar Moreira]], Eduardo Lourenço, Cristina Roldão, ...), 
- to books (e.g. [[Memórias da plantação]], [[Atlantica - contemporary art from Cabo Verde, Guinea Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe and their Diásporas]] and the remaining series, [[Epistemologias do sul - Boaventura de Sousa Santos]], [[Volta para tua terra]], ...), 
- to music (e.g. by [[Dino d' Santiago]], [[Valete]], [[Allen Halloween]], [[Azagaia]], [[Terapia de grupo & Os Heróis - Capicua]], [[Peça Desculpas, Senhor Presidente - Luca Argel]], [[Povo pequenino - Fado Bicha]], ...), 
- to films (by [[Welket Bungué]], [[A Guerra - Joaquim Furtado]], [[Quilombo]], ...), 
- to performances (e.g. by [[Panaibra Gabriel Canda]], [[Opera to a Black Venus]], [[De-Re-Memorization of Portuguese Colonialism and Dictatorship]],  [[A Nossa Última Manhã Aqui - Manuel Tur]], ...), 
- to visual art (e.g. by [[Sandim Mendes]], [[Mónica de Miranda]], [[Irineu Destourelles]], [[Catarina Simão]], [[The singularity of Tchiloli - René Tavares]], [[(Re)descobertas - Olavo Amado]], ...), 
- to exhibitions (e.g. [[Unearthing memories]],  [[Problemas do Primitivismo – a partir de Portugal]]) 
- and other artifacts (e.g. [[Jornal O negro]], Hangar, Bazofo & Dentu Zona, ...), 

I feel like I can make a meaningful contribution by re-writing this treasured and deeply cherished book in order to retell our history, revisit colonisation and its perpetual violence, through the writings of de-colonial thinkers and makers.

## Rhizomatic methodologies for rewriting

As a white Portuguese person, the idea of "retelling our history" is biased and can be looked at dangerously from afar. Thus, the methodology use is of utmost importance in this work. I intend to guide the process through the frameworks delineated by Édouard Glissant in Poetics of Relation.
