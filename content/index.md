## considerations 
-  Should I include other languages, such as Kimbundu or Badiu, even if I don't speak/know them? Portuguese, as a colonial language, carries embedded power structures. Incorporating other indigenous languages, code-switching, and neologisms could help at undermining Portuguese language hegemony. Ok, but then I am writing mostly in Portuguese, how does that undermine anything? It could disrupt a passive consumption of the text by refusing the uniformity of a single/dominant language. So, instead of reading seamlessly, the readers would encounter shifts between languages that could destabilize their flow.  + Mixing languages, can allow for telling experiences in ways that portuguese can't fully capture, making a more inclusive historical discourse. However, it must be a collaborative and very sensitive process. Without collaboration, it risks extractive linguistic tourism.

-  Should I translate sources to Portuguese to use them? My role as translator? Or how can I trust translated sources? Does it then make sense to translate other languages? I think not? - Translation can flatten nuance and reassert colonial power. If I do it, how can I acknowledge the violence of translation? (José Eduardo Agualusa’s _A General Theory of Oblivion_ weaves Kimbundu untranslated, forcing readers to confront their ignorance.)

- How can I work rhizomatically? Is experimental writing (by using texts from many different sources and authors), not writing, but puzzling, in the sense that the original text is not necessarily the root, rhizomatic? Can it ever be? Would maintain the original structure not be rhizomatic? how can we explode within structure?

- **Instead of a single authoritative voice**, experimental writing can incorporate multiple perspectives. But who am I as an orchestrator of these voices operating from an european framework? How to ensure that communities lead this reimagining, and don't just inform it?Should I hold power as editor? and what does this power look like? How can I be a co-author? Do I want to be a co-author? How to let speakers write their own sections without my mediation? The words don't need to “make sense” to a Portuguese gaze. How to keep balance between zine-like chaos and a rhizomatic attitude? How to navigate between intentional fragmentation and accidental incoherence? 

## thought log

**05/04/2025** 

Possible names "Os Tugas", "O desenterro", "Uma época nada épica", ...
I am quite overwhelmed specially after reading [[Atlantica - contemporary art from Cabo Verde, Guinea Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe and their Diásporas]]. I have a huge amount of references just from the West coast, and it feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole, with no longer signs of light. Maybe that's good. But not good for the limited time I have. 
I started writing the Proposition, and have done 2 stanzas so far (2/1102 - 0.018% of the original). It's not as hard to do as I thought it would be. Having to make it decasyllabic (which does not mean 10 syllables) increases the complexity and time consumption, but it's actually quite fun. 
I had a meeting with Mariana (see [[Mariana Aboim#^meeting-1]]) and with Sandim (see [[Sandim Mendes#^meeting-1]]), and have realised I should immediately write about it rather than weeks after, everything is quite foggy now. 
In the two current stanzas, I used [[Poetics of Relation]], [[Cães de raça]], [[Maçonaria]], [[Povo no poder]] and [[Os Lusíadas#Canto I]]. I refrained from using [[Memórias da plantação]], which I was prepared to do, as I want to contact the artist regarding this use first. I am unsure on what to do in situations where the artists have already passed away. For the sake of prototyping and having a somewhat a proof of concept of what I am trying to do, for better understanding, I have used the mentioned references - not publicly available.
I am thinking now I don't want to use sources (in english e.g.) that are not translated, or sources that are not in Portuguese or ex-colony/diaspora languages. It's too much work to be a translator as well, and having to consider my role as such, while at the same time having a whole underground world of Lusophonic resources worth exploring. I want to focus on this undergroundness. English and other work of course can serve me as theoretical basis.

Last note, on a nice sentence: "**to reinsert the history of colonisation into the history of our country**", as a thought on the role of the book regarding Joacine's thoughts  (see [[Atlantica - contemporary art from Cabo Verde, Guinea Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe and their Diásporas#^return-colonial-pain-to-its-thinkers]]).

**26/03/2025** 

Canto I is divided in Proposition, Invocation and Dedication. When thinking of following the same structure, I wonder what would be Proposition, Invocation and Dedication. For instance:

**Proposition**: to deconstruct the celebrated narratives of colonialism, to come to terms with our own history, to recognise ourselves in the mistakes of the past, to encourage the country to make reparations, and ultimately to prompt the transformation of our collective identity.

**Invocation:** To all the writers, artists, revolutionaries, and thinkers—living and dead—whose words dismantle these celebrated narratives and dream beyond its ruins

**Dedication:** to the erased, the insurgent, the resistance, the anti-colonial figures, such as Amílcar Cabral, to freedom, to those who contribute to the rhizome, to women, to those who refuse worship to the "Great Men". 

**14/03/2025**

A few nice sentences I gathered.
Identity (and national identity) as something that is formed through encounters rather than through a stable, self-contained essence.

**"We clamor for the right to opacity"** — Édouard Glissant (Resisting the expectation that all meaning must be extracted and flattened into colonial logic) 

Have a role as a weaver, not an author, tying threads others have spined.

My role isn’t to “make sense” but to architect a space where the own idea of sense can be contested.

Research question draft 1:
**How can experimental writing deconstruct the celebrated narratives of colonialism that define Portuguese national identity?** 
Here "celebrated narratives of colonialism" include [[Os Lusíadas]]. Does the question pertain to the idea of pride associated with colonialism? and does it associate this pride with a foundation for a national identity?

Sub-questions:
-  How are narratives of colonialism celebrated within Portuguese culture?
	- [[Os Lusíadas]]
-  What is national identity (a nation) and how does it relate to these narratives?
	- Nation as defined per myth (Homi K. Bhabha, Nation as Narration)
	- How do epic poems solidify the myth? ([[Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics]])
	- *Saudade* and the case for Portugal (The Power and Limits of Cultural Myths in Portugal’s Search for a Post-Imperial Role, Bruno C. Reis and Pedro A. Oliveira; # “Portugality”: a nothingness that is nothing, E. Lourenço; Eduardo Lourenço – an analysis of the Portuguese destiny, E. Lourenço, and such...)
-  What is experimental writing and how can it be applied as tool in this context?
	- Can experimental writing be rhizomatic?

**11/03/2025** 

Portuguese national identity is still insanely fragile, grasping to breath through the ruthless claws of a fallen empire, it clings to colonialism to beg for an existence as a collective -the lack of imagination in who could we be if not conquerors, navigators, and intricately connected to a sea of bodies cries in our shores. We look to the richness as expansion and  materiality, and so we have been bottomlessly tripping since the 1400s. Epic poems ([[Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics]]) are the spontaneous vomit of a falling empire in desperation to form a cohesive identity. It then makes sense that [[Os Lusíadas]] is still the pinnacle of Portuguese literature. Ultimately, [[Os Lusíadas]] is a project of myth-making haunted by the very failure it tries to suppress. The question then remains, how can Portugal rewrite itself beyond the empire? And further, how can it rewrite itself rhizomaticaly ([[Poetics of Relation]]) - through rupture and its diaspora.

**28/02/2025** 

After getting some feedback yesterday, I am now certain that rewriting this book has to mean using exactly the same structure, syllable count, verses, stanzas. Rewriting it into a different structure means using it as bibliography, as reference, for a new work. That's not the point. The point is a cancellation of the original, a retelling of our history, of what actually happened and its contemporary consequences, a database for black lusophone literature. A big part of Os Lusíadas success comes from its pedantic, and daunting structure - the fact that someone decided to write so much and for so long in this structure is seen as a great feat. How can I strip it of its enchantment if I don't follow the same structure? It leaves room for doubts, it leaves room to say "yes, okay you can criticise it, but Os Lusíadas is still a beacon of national identity for it's epic poem structure".
I realised I want massive collaboration as well. Not just for me to rewrite it by myself, but to have actual contemporary ex-col/diaspora voices rewriting it as well. To have different languages - Badiu, Kimbundu (that originates many "slang" words in portuguese), papiamento, ... as many as possible. As many authors as possible, writers, poets, rappers, musicians, film makers, visual artists, anyone ... 
Os Lusíadas 2 is a terrible name. Looking for others.
I want to talk about a huge variety of topics and origins, and not a linear journey. Not a journey like in the original. Food origins, Music, Fado, Kuduro, Language, Erasure, Names, Dance, Money, Gods/Myths, Revolts, Defeats and Successes... Which characters can I have? Who is the villain, who is the hero, who are the gods and the muses?

**26/02/2025** 

I feel like there has to be an overarching narrative, and this is preventing me from starting with the material. Reading everything first, rather than just doing. For fear of bad results. Thinking that there has to be a connection between the meaning of each chapter and the sources I use. Or that I have to somewhat follow the chapters, and what that means. What my position as the writer means, also scares me.
