##### todo
- [x] import references from phone images
- [ ] import aesthetics
- [ ] import experimental writing techniques (https://gleaming-join-3fc.notion.site/references-ideas-techniques-2afd4af098b242eda61b21e4ab4bf33f#7a6b6f8c621f4a5c812232a7d261186c)

##### considerations
-  should I include creole, even if I don't speak/know creole?
-  should I translate sources to Portuguese to use them? My role as translator? Or how can I trust translated sources?
- how many is too many references?

##### thought log
-  I feel like there has to be an overarching narrative, and this is preventing me from starting with the material. Reading everything first, rather than just doing. For fear of bad results. Thinking that there has to be a connection between the meaning of each chapter and the sources a use. Or that I have to somewhat follow the chapters, and what that means.
