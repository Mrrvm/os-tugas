## considerations
-  Should I include other languages, such as Kimbundu or Badiu, even if I don't speak/know them? Portuguese, as a colonial language, carries embedded power structures. Incorporating other indigenous languages, code-switching, and neologisms could help at undermining Portuguese language hegemony. Ok, but then I am writing mostly in Portuguese, how does that undermine anything? It could disrupt a passive consumption of the text by refusing the uniformity of a single/dominant language. So, instead of reading seamlessly, the readers would encounter shifts between languages that could destabilize their flow.  + Mixing languages, can allow for telling experiences in ways that portuguese can't fully capture, making a more inclusive historical discourse. However, it must be a collaborative and very sensitive process.

-  Should I translate sources to Portuguese to use them? My role as translator? Or how can I trust translated sources? Does it then make sense to translate these other languages? I think not?

- How can I work rhizomatically? Is experimental writing (by using texts from many different sources and authors), not writing, but puzzling, in the sense that the original text is not necessarily the root, rhizomatic? Can it ever be? 

- Instead of a single authoritative voice, experimental writing can incorporate multiple perspectives. But who am I as an orchestrator of these voices? 

## thought log

**13/03/2025 -** 
Research question draft 1:
**How can experimental writing deconstruct the celebrated narratives of colonialism that define Portuguese national identity?** 
Here "celebrated narratives of colonialism" include [[Os Lusíadas]]. Does the question pertain to the idea of pride associated with colonialism? and does it associate this pride with a foundation for a national identity?

Sub-questions:
-  How are narratives of colonialism celebrated within Portuguese culture?
	- [[Os Lusíadas]]
-  What is national identity (a nation) and how does it relate to these narratives?
	- Nation as defined per myth (Homi K. Bhabha, Nation as Narration)
	- How do epic poems solidify the myth? ([[Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics]])
	- *Saudade* and the case for Portugal (The Power and Limits of Cultural Myths in Portugal’s Search for a Post-Imperial Role, Bruno C. Reis and Pedro A. Oliveira; # “Portugality”: a nothingness that is nothing, E. Lourenço; Eduardo Lourenço – an analysis of the Portuguese destiny, E. Lourenço, and such...)
-  What is experimental writing and how can it be applied as tool in this context?
	- Can experimental writing be rhizomatic?

**11/03/2025** - Portuguese national identity is still insanely fragile, grasping to breath through the ruthless claws of a fallen empire, it clings to colonialism to beg for an existence as a collective -the lack of imagination in who could we be if not conquerors, navigators, and intricately connected to a sea of bodies cries in our shores. We look to the richness as expansion and  materiality, and so we have been bottomlessly tripping since the 1400s. Epic poems ([[Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics]]) are the spontaneous vomit of a falling empire in desperation to form a cohesive identity. It then makes sense that [[Os Lusíadas]] is still the pinnacle of Portuguese literature. Ultimately, [[Os Lusíadas]] is a project of myth-making haunted by the very failure it tries to suppress. The question then remains, how can Portugal rewrite itself beyond the empire? And further, how can it rewrite itself rhizomaticaly ([[Poetics of Relation]]) - through rupture and its diaspora.

**28/02/2025** - After getting some feedback yesterday, I am now certain that rewriting this book has to mean using exactly the same structure, syllable count, verses, stanzas. Rewriting it into a different structure means using it as bibliography, as reference, for a new work. That's not the point. The point is a cancellation of the original, a retelling of our history, of what actually happened and its contemporary consequences, a database for black lusophone literature. A big part of Os Lusíadas success comes from its pedantic, and daunting structure - the fact that someone decided to write so much and for so long in this structure is seen as a great feat. How can I strip it of its enchantment if I don't follow the same structure? It leaves room for doubts, it leaves room to say "yes, okay you can criticise it, but Os Lusíadas is still a beacon of national identity for it's epic poem structure".
I realised I want massive collaboration as well. Not just for me to rewrite it by myself, but to have actual contemporary ex-col/diaspora voices rewriting it as well. To have different languages - Badiu, Kimbundu (that originates many "slang" words in portuguese), papiamento, ... as many as possible. As many authors as possible, writers, poets, rappers, musicians, film makers, visual artists, anyone ... 
Os Lusíadas 2 is a terrible name. Looking for others.
I want to talk about a huge variety of topics and origins, and not a linear journey. Not a journey like in the original. Food origins, Music, Fado, Kuduro, Language, Erasure, Names, Dance, Money, Gods/Myths, Revolts, Defeats and Successes... Which characters can I have? Who is the villain, who is the hero, who are the gods and the muses?

**26/02/2025** - I feel like there has to be an overarching narrative, and this is preventing me from starting with the material. Reading everything first, rather than just doing. For fear of bad results. Thinking that there has to be a connection between the meaning of each chapter and the sources I use. Or that I have to somewhat follow the chapters, and what that means. What my position as the writer means, also scares me.
