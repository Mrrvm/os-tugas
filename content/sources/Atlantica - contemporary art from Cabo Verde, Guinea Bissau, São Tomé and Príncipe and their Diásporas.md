-Inocência Mata

"People literally need to take a steps backwards to reclaim the past so as to understand the present an why and how they have come to be where they are and who they are today." - Kofi Poku Quan-Baffour 2012, 3

"(...) proposing to **counter the official tendency of "forgetfulness" as a condition for "reconciliation", through dynamically historical dialogue** with the sagacity of the ancestors in the search for solutions to the anxieties of the present."

"(...) a rhizome 'does not begin or conclude, it is always in the middle, between things, an inter-being, intermezzo. The tree is affiliation, but the rhizome is alliance. The tree imposes the verb "to be", but the rhizome has as tissues the conjunction: "and...and... and..." In this conjunction there is enough strength to shake and uproot the verb "to be". (...)'.  - [[Rhizome - Gille Deleuze]]

"(...) how to transform marginalised communities into a social, historical, cultural presence, neutralising their invisibility - or rather the process of invisibility."
