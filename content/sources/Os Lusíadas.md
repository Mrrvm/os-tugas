Written by Luís Vaz de Camões (1524-1580). He began writing in 1550 and it was published in 1572. D. Sebastian (1554) became king in 1557 and took control of the throne in 1568 (14 years old). When he went to North Africa in 1578, he was 24. Sebastian’s disastrous campaign led to Portugal’s decline and eventual annexation by Spain in 1580 (when Camões died).

## Canto I
#### Proposition: 
The poet begins his poem by ==stating what he intends to do== and succinctly indicating the subject of his narrative: ==singing of the navigators who made the Portuguese empire== in the East possible, the kings who promoted the expansion of faith and empire, all those who become worthy of admiration for their heroic deeds.
#### Invocation: 
==The poet addresses the Tagides (nymphs of the Tagus) to ask for inspiration== to execute, with great style and eloquence, the work he proposes to accomplish; the grandeur of the subject implied the help of the entities that protect artists.
#### Dedication:
==The poet dedicates his work to King Sebastian.== The fact that Camões includes the dedication in his poem accentuates the nationalist aspect of the poem, although this fact also reflects the status of the artist who, although intellectually superior, is economically dependent on a patron, a protector.

Luís de Camões saw King Sebastian as the last hope for revitalizing Portugal’s empire. At the same time, the poem expressed deep anxieties about the empire's decline. This apparent contradiction reflects both Camões’ loyalty to the monarchy and his awareness of the geopolitical realities of the time.

Why Did Camões Dedicate _Os Lusíadas_ to King Sebastian?

- **Patronage and Recognition** – It was common for poets to dedicate their works to monarchs to secure royal favor and financial support. Camões, who had spent years in poverty and exile, needed recognition from the young king.

- **Hope in a New Ruler** – Sebastian, who became king in 1557 as a child, was seen by many as the potential savior of Portugal’s imperial ambitions. Camões, despite his cynicism, likely wanted to inspire the young king to reclaim the empire’s former glory.

- **A Call to Action** – Throughout _Os Lusíadas_, Camões celebrates Portugal’s past but also warns of moral decay and poor governance. By dedicating the poem to Sebastian, he was urging him to lead wisely and avoid the mistakes of his predecessors.

Why Did He Think the Empire Would Decline?

- **Overextension and Economic Strain** – Portugal’s empire was vast, stretching from Brazil to Africa and Asia, but maintaining it was costly. Corruption, poor leadership, and the reliance on colonial wealth rather than internal production weakened the economy.

- **Threats from Rivals** – Spain, the Ottoman Empire, and Dutch traders were challenging Portuguese dominance in different regions. The Dutch, in particular, were beginning to disrupt Portuguese control in the Indian Ocean.

- **Internal Corruption and Complacency** – Camões criticises the greed and moral decline of Portugal’s ruling class, suggesting that their corruption would lead to the empire’s downfall.

- **Sebastian’s Reckless Plans** – By the time Camões published _Os Lusíadas_, Sebastian was already obsessed with launching a crusade in North Africa. This ambition would ultimately lead to Portugal’s downfall at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in 1578, where the king and much of the Portuguese nobility were killed.

Camões himself **experienced** the effects of this corruption. While serving in the empire, he **was imprisoned in Goa** (possibly for debts or conflicts with corrupt officials). His harsh experiences in the colonies gave him insight into how greed and poor leadership were weakening the empire.
