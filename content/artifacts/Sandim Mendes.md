**Meeting on 30/03/2025** (~2h)
Amazing meeting. We really talked a lot and in depth about the subject, my project, how Sandim's work relates, etc... Sandim is not aware of the Portuguese context, so we went through all the aspects of the project from the why, to its urgency, relevance, importance, ethical stance regarding appropriation, ... She gave me a few references: [[Toward final victory!]], [[White innocence - Gloria Wekker]], to talk to Rolando Vazquez Melken, https://amysuowu.net/  and Reinhart on how to coordinate/orchestrate a project like this. ^meeting-1
