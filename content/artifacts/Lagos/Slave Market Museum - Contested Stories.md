"In 2009, a parking lot construction project in Valle da Gafaria (Leper Valley), a site just outside the original walls of the city of Lagos, uncovered two burial sites. One of these was an urban waste dump found to contain 158 bodies dating back to the 15th century.8 Several factors led researchers to believe that these skeletons belonged to enslaved Africans: the bodies had been thrown into the grave haphazardly, in disregard of Christian burial traditions. Furthermore, several objects suggesting that the bodies were those of enslaved people – including a rare amulet, a replica of which is on display in the Slave Market Museum itself – were found inter alia. A conclusion was reached after the application of morphological analysis: the bodies belonged to men, women and children inhumed in a variety of positions, some of whom had been buried with their hands and arms shackled. These bodies were a significant discovery in the field of forensic anthropology, with researchers noting in 2016 that ‘[n]ot only are there few cemeteries of enslaved people in the world, but until now, Lagos is the only sample to be discovered and studied in the Old World.’"

"During the first half of the 20th century under the António de Oliveira Salazar dictatorship (1932-1974), projects were ongoing throughout Portugal which aimed to restructure Portugal’s customs houses. However, in the case of Lagos’s custom house building, inspectors came to the conclusion that the facades of the building should not in any way be modified.19 In fact, rather than remodeling completely the customs house, it was instead decided that the building should be classified as a Monumento Histórico (Historic Monument) due to the fact that it marked the site where enslaved people were first sold in Lagos. It thus constituted, in the eyes of the regime, an important monument celebrating Portugal’s Século de Ouro (Golden Age), the period in which Portugal rose in prominence as a colonial power – a success premised, among other things, on finance generated from the slave trade. In light of this, it becomes clear that the building’s function has been utterly transformed: where it was once preserved as a monument to slavery, it now functions as a museum which seeks to explore and critically engage with Portugal’s historic involvement in the trade. Whether the museum’s engagement with its subject matter is sufficient remains up for discussion."
