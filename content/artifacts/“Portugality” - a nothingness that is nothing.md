"Eduardo Lourenço underlined a Portuguese hyper-identity due to a deficit of real identity, which tends to compensate on the imaginary level."

"The expression “Portugality” seems to have become naturalized. The current President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, for example, regularly uses this expression. It is worth remembering that this was forged in the middle of the Estado Novo (50s-60s of the 20th century) - the Portuguese dictatorship -, when Lusotropicalism developed Gilberto Freyre’s theory (at least in what was appropriated by the regime at the time). The intention was to validate the slogan “Portugal from Minho to Timor”, looking at the idea then in vogue that “Portugal is not a small country”, which wanted the then overseas provinces to be seen by the UN - to which Portugal was trying to adhere - not as autonomous territories, but as an integral part of Portuguese territory (Sousa, 2017; 2021)." (see [[Marcas de Lusotropicalismo no Marcelo]])
