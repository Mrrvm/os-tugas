"**Portugal has numerous sites that recall the country’s involvement in the Atlantic trade of enslaved peoples. Nonetheless, the memorialization of those places has not been a concern. A combination of factors explains this absence of memorial sites, contributing to the minimizing of the role played by the country in the trade of enslaved African peoples.**"

"Having in mind the situation in other countries, namely in the United Kingdom, home to the International Slavery Museum, how can we explain this lack of memorial sites in Portugal? In order to answer this question, it is necessary to understand that the Portuguese expansion, during which the Atlantic trade of enslaved African peoples emerged, continues to be viewed in a positive light, even today."
