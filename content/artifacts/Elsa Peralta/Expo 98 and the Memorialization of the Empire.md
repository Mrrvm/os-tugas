Since I can remember, my family had a glass cup with a cartoon called Gil at home. This was the mascot of the Expo 98 meant as a reference to Gil Eanes, the navigator from [[Lagos]], that passed through Western Sahara. 

Expo 98 was a world exhibition whose theme was "The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future", chosen in part to commemorate 500 years of Portuguese maritime expansion.

"At the opening ceremony of the Eleventh Web Summit in Lisbon, in early November 2019, the mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina, offered an astrolabe to Paddy Cosgrave, the founder of the technology and entrepreneurship conference. As an instrument used by the navigators during the so-called Portuguese “Discoveries,” the astrolabe possessed a symbolism that Medina emphasized at the time: Lisbon was the capital of the world five centuries ago, this was the starting point for routes to discover new worlds, new people, new ideas. ==From Lisbon departed a great adventure that connected the human race. . . . Today it is you, the engineers, the entrepreneurs, the creators, the innovators, the start-ups, all the companies==. (Lusa 2017c)"

"This narrative started to be regenerated in the mid-1980s, on the basis of old imperial myths woven since nineteenth-century liberalism and the First Republic (1910–1926) and intensified during the Estado Novo (1933–1974), but more recently has become adapted to the new postcolonial languages and the symbolic demands of European integration (Peralta 2017). (...) But as the young Portuguese democracy was being successfully implemented and the country was on its way ==toward eventually acceding to the European Economic Market in 1986, Portuguese national identity started to be reworked to fit into the new political and cultural context of liberal democracies. In this way, Portugal’s imperial history began to serve once again as a chief rhetorical tool for locating Portugal in a new space of European identity,== a space now dominated by notions of multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism."

"This rehabilitation began in 1983 with the inclusion of the ==Jerónimos Monastery and the Belém Tower in UNESCO’s World Heritage List. UNESCO justifies this classification with the observation that the two monuments “reflect the power, knowledge and courage of the Portuguese people== at a time when they consolidated their presence and domain of intercontinental trade routes” and recall “the pioneer role the Portuguese had in the 15th and 16th centuries in cre- ating contacts, dialogue and interchange among different cultures” (UNESCO, n.d.). Since ==UNESCO is an institution that represents a culture of peace, democ- racy, and cooperation in the world=="
