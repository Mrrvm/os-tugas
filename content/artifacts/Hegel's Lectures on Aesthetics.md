Mentioned in [[Poetics of Relation]]

Hegel’s view of the epic as a reflection of national spirit helps explain _Os Lusíadas_ as a project of **territorial justification**. The poem doesn’t just recount Vasco da Gama’s journey—it frames Portuguese expansion as part of a divine and historical mandate. By blending mythological validation (gods endorsing the Portuguese, and the mission to spread Christianism) with historical narrative (real conquests), Camões **normalises colonialism** as a heroic and inevitable mission. The text functions as a **justification for empire** by:

1. **Creating a myth** – The journey is not just economic expansion, but framed as a civil duty, guided by fate and faith.
2. **Defining a moral superiority** – The Portuguese are depicted as brave and righteous, while indigenous people and rival powers are often shown as obstacles to be overcome.
3. **Making up a divine endorsement** – Venus supports the Portuguese, reinforcing their conquests as sanctioned by higher powers.

This aligns with Hegel’s idea that epics are **expressions of a national consciousness**, shaping how people perceive themselves in relation to land and history.

#### General Character of Epic

**Preliminary characteristics of an epic**

"**(a)** (...) consists in extracting from the concrete world and its wealth of changing phenomena something which is necessary and self-grounded and expressing that independently, concentrated into epic phraseology.
(...)
==The author is not yet expressing his own concrete self; on the contrary, he looks around and attaches to the object or place which he sees confronting him==, and which is claiming his interest, a compressed explanation concerned with the kernel of the thing itself.
(...)
We find the next step taken when the duality of the externally real object and the inscription is expunged, i.e. ==when the poet expresses his idea of the object, without having the object present before his eyes. (...) which put together in a compressed form what is stronger than things we can see, more enduring and universal than the memorial of a specific deed, more lasting than votive offerings, temples, and pillars, – namely the duties of our human existence== (...) The epic character in this mode of treatment consists in this, that ==maxims like these are not expressions of personal feeling or purely individual reflection, and neither is even the impression they make directed to our feelings with a view to touching us or promoting some interest of the heart, but instead they evoke an awareness that what is of intrinsic worth must be regarded as a human duty, as what is decent and honourable.==
(...)
This is because in this totality ==the unity holding the parts together, and the real centre, is not provided by a purely lyrical mood or a dramatic action but by a specific and real sphere of life,== the essential nature of which is to be brought home to our minds both in its general character and also in its particular trends, aspects, occurrences, duties, etc. Conformably with this whole stage of epic, which exhibits the permanent and the universal ==as such with the chiefly ethical aim of warning, teaching, and summoning to an inherently sterling moral life, productions of this kind acquire a didactic tone;== (...) and, by allowing the descriptive element its necessary scope too, ==they prove completely that the whole of their doctrine and description is directly drawn from a reality that has been grasped in its substance and lived through==.(...)
"

"**(b)** (...) 
==Intensified by contemplating the greatness of this object and by struggling with its majesty, the soul’s enthusiasm begins to become lyrical at the same time; but the entire exposition of the truths entering the poet’s thinking has a purely matter-of-fact and therefore epic character.== 
(...)
the subject-matter is the coming-to-be of things, especially of nature, and the tumult and conflict of activities dominant in nature. Here the poetic ==imagination proceeds to present an occurrence more concretely and richly in the form of deeds and events, because it personifies more or less definitely the natural powers that work themselves out in different spheres and productions, and it clothes them symbolically with human events and actions.==
(...)
 The familiar example of such an epic way of putting things is the _Theogony_ transmitted to us as by Hesiod. In this work, ==everything that happened takes the form of human events, and it remains all the less purely symbolic the more are the gods, with spiritual dominion as their vocation, free to take the shape of spiritual individuality which corresponds with their essential being, and for this reason they are justified in acting, and being portrayed, as human beings.==
 (...)
 strictly human reality which must alone provide the truly concrete material for the sway of the divine powers."

**A proper epic**

"**(c)** (...) while what is genuinely poetic is concrete spirit in an individual form; and ==the epic, having _what is_ as its topic, acquires as its object the occurrence of an action which in the whole breadth of its circumstances and relations must gain access to our contemplation as a rich event connected with the total world of a nation and epoch==. Consequently ==the content and form of epic proper is the entire world-outlook and objective manifestation of a national spirit presented in its self-objectifying shape as an actual event.== This whole comprises both the religious consciousness, springing from all the depths of the human spirit, and also concrete existence political and domestic life right down to the details of external existence, human needs and means for their satisfaction; and epic animates this whole by developing it in close contact with individuals, because what is universal and substantive enters poetry only as the living presence of the spirit.
(...)
Further, such a total world, which nevertheless is concentrated into individual lives, must proceed tranquilly in the course of its realization, ==without hurrying on practically and dramatically towards some mark and the result of aiming at it, so that we can linger by what goes on, immerse ourselves in the individual pictures in the story and enjoy them in all their details.== (...) ==the epic poem becomes rather diffuse and, owing to the relatively greater independence of its parts, is rather loosely connected together,== we still must not suppose that it may be composed bit by bit on and on, for on the contrary, like any other work of art, it must as poetry be finished off into an inherently organic whole; yet it moves forward in objective tranquillity so that we can take an interest in the detail itself and the pictures of living reality.
(...)
To this extent these memorials are nothing less than the proper foundations of a national consciousness 
(...)
In epic proper the childlike consciousness of a people is expressed for the first time in poetic form. A genuine epic poem therefore falls into that middle period in which a people has awakened out of torpidity, and its spirit has been so far strengthened as to be able to produce its own world and feel itself at home in it,
(...)
(...) _lyrically_ its dwelling on self and its preoccupation with the inner life of the individual; (...) But epic still demands that immediate unity of feeling with action, of inner aims logically pursued along with external accidents and events, a unity which in its original and undisrupted character occurs only in the earliest periods of poetry and a nation’s life.
But we must not put the matter at all as if a people in its heroic age as such, the cradle of its epic, already had the skill to be able to describe itself poetically; ==for a nationality to be implicitly poetic in its actual life is one thing, but poetry as the imaginative consciousness of poetic material and as the artistic presentation of such a world is another thing altogether==. The need to make play with _ideas_ in such a presentation, i.e. the development of art, ==necessarily arises later than the life and the spirit which is naïvely at home in its immediate poetic existence==. Homer and the poems bearing his name are centuries later than the Trojan war which counts as an actual fact just as much as Homer is for me an historical individual.
(...)
In spite of this separation in time, a close connection must nevertheless still be left between the poet and his material. The poet must still be wholly absorbed in these old circumstances, ways of looking at things, and faith, and all he needs to do is to bring a poetic consciousness and artistic portrayal to his subject which is in fact the real basis of his actual life. (...) ==If, then, the spirit of the artist is different from that through which the actual life and deeds of the nation described acquired their existence, then this produces a cleavage which at once confronts us as inappropriate and disturbing.== For in that case we see on the one side scenes of a past world, and, on the other, forms, attitudes of mind, modes of reflection belonging to a different present. ==The result is that the forms of the earlier faith now become, in the midst of this further developed reflective mentality, a cold affair, a superstition, and an empty decoration provided by poetic machinery, and they wholly lack their original soul and proper life.=="

**The general position which the poet has to take up in the case of epic proper**
