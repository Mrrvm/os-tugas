Mentioned in [[Poetics of Relation]]

Hegel’s view of the epic as a reflection of national spirit helps explain _Os Lusíadas_ as a project of **territorial justification**. The poem doesn’t just recount Vasco da Gama’s journey—it frames Portuguese expansion as part of a divine and historical mandate. By blending mythological validation (gods endorsing the Portuguese, and the mission to spread Christianism) with historical narrative (real conquests), Camões **normalises colonialism** as a heroic and inevitable mission. The text functions as a **justification for empire** by:

1. **Creating a myth** – The journey is not just economic expansion, but framed as a civil duty, guided by fate and faith.
2. **Defining a moral superiority** – The Portuguese are depicted as brave and righteous, while indigenous people and rival powers are often shown as obstacles to be overcome.
3. **Making up a divine endorsement** – Venus supports the Portuguese, reinforcing their conquests as sanctioned by higher powers.

This aligns with Hegel’s idea that epics are **expressions of a national consciousness**, shaping how people perceive themselves in relation to land and history.
